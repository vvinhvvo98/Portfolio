    @section secs_1 OVERVIEW
    This website showcases the culmination of my efforts as a Mechanical Engineering student at Cal Poly. 
    It encompasses a diverse range of projects, including personal mechatronics projects, Cal Poly senior projects, and those undertaken during my internships.
    While the website provides comprehensive details about each project, I encourage you to explore any linked external resources for a deeper understanding. 
    Additionally, my YouTube channel features videos showcasing these projects in action.
